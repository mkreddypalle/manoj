    <p class="para">From a young village boy to a teacher, actor, producer, writer, Member of Parliament, philanthropist, and an
      educationist – it has been 3 decades of being at the service of my people. Yet, every bit of this enchanting
      journey runs fresh in my mind. After all, at heart, I am still that dreamer from Modhugulapalem who followed his
      father's footsteps to become an educator. A proud son of a dedicated school headmaster; it humbles me to have
      continued his legacy, ﬁrst as a teacher myself and then as the Chairman of the renowned Sree Vidyanikethan
      Educational Trust (SVET). Ever since its inception in 1992, the seed of SVET has ﬂourished into a large
      Kalpavriksha – helping thousands of young learners fulﬁll their aspirations. This in turn has led to SVET
      institutions garnering an immense amount of trust and reliance from students, their families and the industry
      alike.</p>
    <p class="paraone">With this, my long-standing dream of helping the nation’s youth to realize their potential is also culminating
      into a larger vision. It is gratifying to witness all the years of hard work, commitment, and passion with SVET
      now transforming into a universe of possibilities at Mohan Babu University in Tirupati. MBU's advanced curriculum,
      expert mentorship, best-in-class facilities with a safe 5 star rated campus and 65+ clubs are poised to help
      students innovate, learn and lead the next, today. In a constantly changing world, only talent that is
      future-ready can take the baton ahead. Therefore, MBU focuses on delivering a unique blend of academic brilliance,
      discipline and dynamism. Groomed in such an inspiring culture, a community of thousands of students is preparing
      for a future of success. I am pleased to see them soar high with rewarding opportunities in companies like Google
      and Amazon this academic year. I am conﬁdent that each one of our students is nurtured and well supported to make
      a difference in a unique way. </p>
